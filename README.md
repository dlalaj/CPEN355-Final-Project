## Description
CPEN 355 Final Project on Denoising Autoencoder architecture for MNIST dataset. Exploring depth and width of neural network to denoising capabalities of autoencoders

## Abstract - A high level idea and motivation rationale:
A major challenge relating to data used for building machine and deep learning models is that the data almost always comes with missing values, outlier points or corrupted features. In particular when working with images of the simplest representation built on one channel pixels, it is common to see strong variation in the intensity which in the context of imaging is perceived as noise. We explore the ability of autoencoder neural networks in de-corrupting images under different architectures and evaluate their performance based on the latent representation shrinkage ratio and the depth of the network.
